# 🚀 Financial Sentiment Analysis

## 📌 Project Title

**Real-time Financial News Sentiment Analysis for Algorithmic Trading and Investment Insights**

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

> In the fast-paced world of finance, market sentiment drives asset prices. Extracting `accurate sentiment` (positive, neutral, negative) from financial text is challenging due to domain-specific jargon and nuances.
> This project builds a **robust NLP model** delivering **real-time sentiment insights** for smarter trading and investment decisions.
